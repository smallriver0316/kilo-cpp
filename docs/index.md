# Build Your Own Text Editor in Modern C++

## Introduction

Welcome to kilo++, a Modern C++ implementation inspired by [antirez's kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108).
This tutorial guides you through building a fully-functional text editor that includes syntax highlighting, search functionality, and other essential features while showcasing modern C++ practices.
